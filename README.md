# Health-Tracker
Our HackDuke project

Requires the use of installer.py in order to work properly.

NutriFact.py is a health and nutrition app that allows a user to take a picture of a food item and view its calorie, sugar and fat content. The app also allows the user to see total nutrition intake for previous days allowing for longterm tracking of nutrition.
