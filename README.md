# Health-Tracker
Our HackDuke project

Requires the use of installer.py in order to work properly.

Change the NutriFact.py code to include your personal Clarifai API key. For security precautions, it was not included in the code.

NutriFact.py is a health and nutrition app that allows a user to take a picture of a food item and view its calorie, sugar and fat content. The app also allows the user to see total nutrition intake for previous days allowing for longterm tracking of nutrition.
